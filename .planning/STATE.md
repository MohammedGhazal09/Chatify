# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-07)

**Core value:** Users can trust Chatify to deliver private real-time conversations reliably, securely, and clearly.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — Messenger Baseline Completion

## Current Position

Phase: 05 (Messenger Baseline Completion) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-09 -- Phase 05 execution started

Progress: 75%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: 34 min
- Total execution time: 5h 10m

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 02-authenticated-realtime-contract | 3 | 2h 15m | 45m |
| 03-canonical-message-state | 3 | 50m | 17m |
| 04-messenger-ui-reconstruction | 3 | 2h 05m | 42m |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 03-02, 03-03, 04-01, 04-02, 04-03
- Trend: Phase 3 canonical message state and Phase 4 messenger UI reconstruction completed with frontend tests, lint, build, and smoke evidence passing

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project direction: Rebuild core chat before broad feature expansion.
- V1 scope: Professional messenger baseline, not minimal repair or full platform.
- Security posture: Blocking security acceptance criteria for auth, socket, and message phases.
- Project structure: Vertical MVP phases.
- Phase 03 backend contract: Message creation is HTTP-only and idempotent by sender/chat/clientMessageId.
- Phase 03 backend contract: Socket and HTTP receipt paths share monotonic status helpers; unread events use absolute `count`.
- Phase 03 backend contract: Delete-for-everyone is a stable redacted tombstone; delete-for-self filters visibility per user.
- Phase 03 frontend contract: TanStack Query owns durable message state; optimistic, socket, mutation, and refetch updates merge by `_id` and `clientMessageId`.
- Phase 03 frontend contract: Failed sends remain visible as failed optimistic messages and retry with the same `clientMessageId`.
- Phase 03 history contract: Message history uses `before`/`limit` cursor pagination over `createdAt` plus `_id`, with display-order responses.
- Phase 03 sidebar contract: Chat list `latestMessage` is projected per requester using message visibility rules instead of trusting stale chat-level state.
- Phase 03 validation contract: Outgoing message text trims before send/edit and shares the backend 1000-character maximum boundary.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Project initialized: Chatify reconstruction roadmap created.
- Phase 1 starts with security and tests because message and socket work is privacy-sensitive.
- Phase 2 planned with 3 sequential waves for authenticated realtime identity, authorization, presence, reconnect, and socket integration verification.
- Phase 2 completed with authenticated socket identity, membership-checked socket events, targeted private emits, privacy-aware presence, reconnect reconciliation, and socket integration tests.
- Phase 3 plan 03-01 completed with canonical backend message state primitives, idempotent create, read/delivery/unread contracts, tombstones, edit/reaction bounds, and 47 passing backend tests.
- Phase 3 plan 03-02 completed with frontend message cache helpers, Query-owned message state, sender-free create payloads, socket cache integration, and 8 passing frontend helper tests plus lint/build.
- Phase 3 plan 03-03 completed with cursor history, per-user latestMessage projection, shared validation boundaries, and full backend/frontend regression verification.
- Phase 3 completed; Phase 4 is ready to rebuild the messenger UI on top of the canonical message state contract.
- Phase 4 plan 04-01 completed with extracted chat components and a focused route orchestrator.
- Phase 4 plan 04-02 completed with UI-SPEC styling, explicit state surfaces, failed-send recovery, accessible controls, and lazy emoji loading.
- Phase 4 plan 04-03 completed with React 19 DOM regression tests, jsdom setup, and smoke evidence.
- Phase 4 completed; Phase 5 can build on the tested messenger baseline.

### Pending Todos

- Review Phase 04 output or continue to Phase 05 messenger baseline completion.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No active blockers.
- Repository hygiene note: `Frontend/Chatify/src/pages/chat/chat.tsx` has no pending diff after committed Phase 04 execution.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
